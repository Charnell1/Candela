<h2>My start </h2>
<p>This is a small business I am hoping to expand greatly. I started out with little to nothing when making candles. For me, making candles was a means of me helping from home and taking care of household things at the same time. Itis definitely a learning process, but having even one customer pays off. Always bet reviews and criticism for your work. The amount of improvement you will avhieve is monumental to your progress and success.</p>

<h2>My experience</h2>
<p> Starting out was rough. Little money for a few supplies seemed pointless to me, but it wasn't. When starting out, never buy in bulk until you co e close to selling out. In this case, on,y being able to buy a little bit helped me test the waters. I had only one loyal customer at the time, and did they help tremendously. I had comfidemce in my product growing slowly, but it still helped.

<h2> My Starter Wax</h2>
<p>The wax I started out with was Paraffin. It is super common and pretty cheap considering the higher quality wax. It's feallly easy go mix scents with as well as dye, so I say get this as a starter and experiment! Don't get discouraged if it doesn't come out right the first time, just keep trying and you will improve. You are not a one man professional candle making company, you are human and mistakes are made. Learn from them!
